# Titanic-Dataset
A binary classification task from Kaggle's Titanic dataset. This is still a work in progress as new techniques from the textbook Deep Learning with Python are still being implemented to increase accuracy. The deep learning API, Keras, is the workhorse behind the implementation of the neural network. In the future, I may try to use SVM's to solve this.
